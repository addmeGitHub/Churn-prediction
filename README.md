# Project Title: Credit Card Customer Attrition Prediction

## Project Overview
This project develops classification models to predict credit card customer attrition for First National Bank, aiming to enhance customer retention and increase revenue from credit cardholders.

## Objective
•	Predict Attrition: Identify customers likely to close their accounts using predictive models.
•	Customer Segmentation: Cluster customers to understand distinct groups and tailor marketing strategies effectively.

## Methods and Models
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Conducted exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset.

### Supervised Learning Models
- Implemented the following supervised learning models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
  - XGBoost
### Unsupervised Learning
- Applied KMeans clustering to segment the customer base.
### Hyperparameter Tuning
- Utilized Randomized Search to optimize model parameters.

## Data Handling
• Data Loading: Ingested data using pandas.
• Handling Imbalance: Applied SMOTE for class imbalance.
• Data Preprocessing: Included encoding, scaling, and splitting into training and test datasets.

## Results
• Classification Performance:
  - Logistic Regression: 86% accuracy, 84% precision.
  - Random Forest: 94.5% accuracy, 94.4% precision.
  - XGBoost: 97% accuracy, 97% precision.
• Clustering Insights:
  - Identified key characteristics of customer groups affecting churn rates.

## Recommendations
• Tailored retention strategies based on customer segmentation.
• Enhanced predictive models for early identification of at-risk customers.
